From the author:
    Yes I know the subject of cloning an operating system between two completely different devices
    is typically a bad idea. However, this tool is primarily aimed at consumer devices that are not
    managed or part of a domain. No issues have presented themselves yet after using this tool.

    That said, it should be communicated that using this tool can carry a significant amount of risk
    and to always back up important data first. Expect to clean install Windows should any
    unforseen incompatibilities prevent the use of this tool.

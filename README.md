# Device-Drivers-Utility
Helps to facilitate driver management between different devices.

How To Use:
1. Run this software from an external storage device connected to the operating system on the device
    you wish to clone to.
2. Ensure all Microsoft accounts are removed/disabled from the device you wish to clone from.
3. Perform the clone from whichever software you prefer.
4. Run this software again, selecting the "import" option and targetting the newly cloned drive.
5. Boot to the cloned device. Be sure to rename the PC before performing any action.
6. Upgrade Windows to a compatible version if device was originally on a newer version.

From the author:
    Yes I know the subject of cloning an operating system between two completely different devices
    is typically a bad idea. However, this tool is primarily aimed at consumer devices that are not
    managed or part of a domain. No issues have presented themselves yet after using this tool.

    That said, it should be communicated that using this tool can carry a significant amount of risk
    and to always back up important data first. Expect to clean install Windows should any
    unforseen incompatibilities prevent the use of this tool and/or render the target device inoperable.
